# Key Differences from Python:

Async/Await Pattern: All HTTP operations are now asynchronous using async/await
Type Safety: Added strongly-typed classes for JSON deserialization (Entity, LegacyAppliance, EndpointItem, etc.)
HttpClient: Used HttpClient instead of the Python requests library
JSON Serialization: Used System.Text.Json for JSON operations
Error Handling: Added try-catch blocks and proper exception handling
Resource Management: Properly disposed of HttpClient in the finally block

# Structure:

Static Methods: All methods are static, mirroring the original Python structure
Data Classes: Created proper C# classes for JSON data structures
Constants: All configuration values are defined as constants at the top
Main Method: Entry point that executes the same sequence as the Python script

# Usage:

Update the configuration constants at the top of the class with your actual values
Add the required NuGet packages:

System.Net.Http (usually included by default)
System.Text.Json (included in .NET Core 3.0+)


To run as a console application, create a new project and replace the Program.cs with this code

# Additional Notes:

The C# version maintains the same logic flow and functionality as the original Python script
Error handling is more robust with try-catch blocks
All HTTP operations are properly async to avoid blocking
JSON deserialization is type-safe with proper classes
Memory management is handled properly with using statements and disposal

The converted code should work identically to your Python script while taking advantage of C#'s type safety and async capabilities.
